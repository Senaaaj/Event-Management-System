			<div class="terms-content">
				<p>By using our online hotel reservation system for special events, you agree to the following terms and conditions.
				All reservations are subject to availability at the time of booking. 
				Guests must provide accurate and complete information during the reservation process, including full name, contact details, and payment information. 
				The hotel reserves the right to cancel or modify any reservation if false or incomplete information is provided.<br>

				A reservation is considered confirmed only after receiving a confirmation email from the hotel, 
				which may require full or partial payment depending on the specific event or promotional offer. 
				Payment terms, including the amount and deadlines, will be clearly stated during the booking process. 
				Failure to meet these payment terms may result in the cancellation of your reservation.<br>

				Special events may have unique policies regarding cancellations, modifications, and refunds. 
				These policies will be communicated to guests during the booking process, and any changes to the reservation must be made within the specified time frame. 
				In most cases, cancellations or modifications must be made at least 7 to 30 days before the event date to avoid penalties, 
				which could range from a cancellation fee to the forfeiture of any deposits or payments already made.<br>

				The hotel may require a minimum stay during peak periods or special events, which will be clearly indicated at the time of booking.
				Additionally, the hotel may impose restrictions on the number of guests per room, 
				and exceeding this limit may result in additional charges or the cancellation of the reservation.<br>

				Guests are responsible for any damages to hotel property caused by themselves or their party during the stay. 
				The hotel reserves the right to charge guests for any such damages, and an additional security deposit may be required for certain events.<br>

				The hotel cannot be held responsible for any unforeseen circumstances or events beyond its control, 
				including natural disasters, strikes, or other force majeure events, that may impact the guest's stay. 
				In such cases, the hotel will make reasonable efforts to accommodate guests or provide alternative arrangements, 
				but no refunds will be issued for cancellations due to these events unless otherwise specified.<br><br><br>

				By completing the reservation, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to these terms and conditions.</p>
